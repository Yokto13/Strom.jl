- [X] PowerIteration
- [X] InversePowerIteration

### For what you can use *this*?
This project was written for practice and from curiosity and I wouldn't recommend
using it in real applications.
It lacks focus on the speed and generally constructs of Julia language (this is literally the
first code I've ever written in Julia).

Nonetheless, you can use it to learn about implementations of the listed
algorithms.
While working on it, I was sometimes looking for other implementations on the
Internet that would help me with debugging my own code.
Interestingly for many algorithms here, you can't find a good reference.
Usually, you can find implementations that are too complex and
super-duper-optimized with the main idea burried, or you might find
nothing at all.

If you look for topnotch implementations of the above I would suggest looking
in [DecisionTree.jl](https://www.juliapackages.com/p/decisiontree),
[LinearAlgebra](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/LinearAlgebra/), and
[XGBoost](https://juliapackages.com/p/xgboost)


### Note regarding boosted trees
The boosted trees were written with the following 
[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02754) in mind and based on what was
summarized in the following [lecture](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/~straka/courses/npfl129/2122/slides/?10#1).
However, they don't use some optimization tricks and the heuristic
for picking the best split might differ.

## Instalation
To run this, you will need Julia in your PATH (download it [here](https://julialang.org/downloads/)).

To install all dependencies go to the project repository,
open REPL (just type julia) and enter *pkg* 
interface by typing `]`.
In *pkg* interface invoke following commands
```
activate .
instantiate
```

From now on, the project is set up as a package (similarly to how it works in
Python). 
You can start any example by
```
julia --project=PATH_TO_REPO PATH_TO_REPO/examples/EXAMPLE
```

or directly from REPL (if the project is already *pkg* activated) like:

```
include("PATH_TO_REPO/examples/EXAMPLE")
```

To load the project as a module, execute the following
```
include("PATH_TO_REPO/src/Strom.jl")
using .Strom
```

With this, you are ready to go.
To see what you might do, it's best to look at the examples directory.

## Plot results
The project also provides plotting functionality.
You can see some results bellow.
